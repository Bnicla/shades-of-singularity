AI plus robotics plus renewable energy creates genuine material abundance - enough food, shelter, energy, and healthcare for every person on Earth at near-zero marginal cost. Keynes's economic problem is solved. Humanity is freed for meaning, creativity, and self-actualization. The barrier is not technological but political: the institutions required to distribute abundance do not exist and face enormous resistance from those who benefit from scarcity.

Post-scarcity requires the simultaneous success of several other scenarios: effective governance of AI power (#2), prevention of neo-feudalism (#14), democratic access (#18), and ecological resolution (#9). Hamilton would argue that post-scarcity is not a gift technology bestows but a political achievement institutions must create. Without distributive mechanisms, abundance concentrates rather than liberates.

**Key tension:** We may achieve the capacity for post-scarcity while remaining trapped in distributive systems designed for scarcity.
