Human consciousness transferred to digital substrate: functional immortality. The technical requirements are staggering: scanning the brain at sufficient resolution to capture dynamic state, modeling computations that produce consciousness, running that model on hardware sustaining subjective experience. The philosophical challenges may be harder still. Is the upload you, or a copy that thinks it's you? Functionalists say if computation is preserved, the person is preserved. Embodiment theorists say consciousness depends on biological substrate in ways computation cannot capture.

If achieved, every framework we use to organize society changes: death becomes optional, population becomes a policy variable, and law and morality must be rebuilt from their foundations. The governed outcome (+3) represents proactive preparation for these disruptions; the unmanaged outcome (-2) represents the chaos of adapting after the fact.

**Key tension:** Whether mind uploading is immortality or sophisticated suicide depends on a question about consciousness that philosophy has not resolved in three thousand years.
