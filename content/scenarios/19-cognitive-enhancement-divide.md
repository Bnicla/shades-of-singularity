Brain-computer interfaces, neuropharmacology, genetic editing, and AI-augmented cognition converge to create fundamentally enhanced human intelligence. Neuralink-type devices, initially medical, expand into cognitive augmentation: enhanced memory, accelerated processing, direct knowledge access. If available only to the wealthy, the result is a new species divide: a gap measured in cognitive capacity rather than wealth.

This has the highest governance dividend in the taxonomy after the intelligence explosion: 7 points. Universal cognitive enhancement would be the greatest equalizer in history. Restricted enhancement would be the greatest divider. Dario Amodei's "Machines of Loving Grace" (2024) envisions AI-driven neuroscience compressing a century of progress into 5-10 years, including effective treatments for most mental illness and even enhancements to everyday cognitive function, but acknowledges that without deliberate policy, such advances could be "only for the rich." The policy choices of the next two decades (IP law, healthcare policy, public investment, international access) determine which materializes. The case for cognitive enhancement as a public right is analogous to the case for public education: democratic governance cannot survive if only the wealthy can think.

The adversarial point: brain-computer interfaces are far from delivering cognitive enhancement to healthy individuals. Current devices address specific medical conditions (paralysis, epilepsy). The leap to augmented cognition for healthy brains requires neuroscience breakthroughs that may be decades away or may never arrive. The 35% likelihood already accounts for this uncertainty, but readers should note that this scenario depends on technological breakthroughs that remain speculative.

**Key tension:** The policy frameworks that will govern cognitive enhancement are being built now, in IP law and healthcare regulation, before the technology arrives.
