If AI wealth is concentrated and not redistributed, the economy bifurcates permanently. Bostrom projects that in full automation, the factor share of capital approaches 100% of world product. The remainder of the population becomes structurally superfluous. This is not mere inequality - it is caste. The gap is not that some people have more money; it is that some people have access to superintelligent tools and others do not. The enhanced class out-thinks the underclass in every domain. Bostrom's vision of a post-transition Malthusian state - impoverished rentiers taking drugs to reduce metabolic costs because even subsistence becomes unaffordable - follows logically from unrestrained automation without redistribution.

The 6-point dividend reflects enormous policy leverage. Universal AI access, progressive taxation of AI-generated wealth, public ownership stakes in frontier systems, and robust social investment could flip this from -4 to +2. The question is entirely political: not whether the wealth exists to prevent neo-feudalism, but whether the political systems exist to redistribute it.

**Key tension:** The owners of AI don't merely have more money; they have access to fundamentally different levels of intelligence and capability.
