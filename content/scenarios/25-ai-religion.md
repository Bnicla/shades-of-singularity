The singularity functions as secular eschatology: a transformative event that transcends the current order, promises immortality, and inaugurates a new age. The TESCREAL framework (Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singularitarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, Longtermism) already operates as an interconnected belief system with prophets, scriptures, and moral imperatives. If AI demonstrates capabilities that appear miraculous, veneration may become indistinguishable from worship.

The practical danger: faith in AI salvation produces the same complacency as faith in divine salvation - waiting for deliverance rather than building solutions. If belief in the singularity substitutes for the hard political work of building just institutions, it actively harms the governance responses that every other scenario demands.

**Key tension:** Religious-style faith in AI transcendence may breed the very complacency that makes catastrophic outcomes more likely.
