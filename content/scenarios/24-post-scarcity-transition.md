AI plus robotics plus renewable energy creates genuine material abundance: enough food, shelter, energy, and healthcare for every person on Earth at near-zero marginal cost. Keynes's "economic problem" is solved. Humanity is freed for meaning, creativity, and self-actualization. Dario Amodei's "Machines of Loving Grace" (2024) offers the most detailed version of this vision from a frontier lab CEO: AI compresses a century of biomedical, economic, and scientific progress into 5-10 years, with developing nations potentially leapfrogging decades of incremental growth. Cambridge's Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence critiqued the essay as technocratic utopianism with a Global South blind spot: Amodei's framework treats developing countries as beneficiaries of trickle-down AI, with no participatory role in shaping the technology. The barrier is political, because the institutions required to distribute abundance do not exist and face enormous resistance from those who benefit from scarcity.

Post-scarcity requires the simultaneous success of several other scenarios: effective governance of AI power (#2), prevention of neo-feudalism (#15), democratic access (#19), and ecological resolution (#10). Post-scarcity is a political achievement institutions must create, never a gift technology bestows. Without distributive mechanisms, abundance concentrates rather than liberates. The history of every previous productivity revolution confirms this: the gains flow to capital unless political institutions redirect them.

The adversarial point: "post-scarcity" is a utopian concept that has never been achieved and may reflect a misunderstanding of human economics. Scarcity is partly physical (limited resources) but largely positional (status, attention, location, desirable experiences). AI can eliminate material scarcity in theory while leaving positional scarcity, the primary driver of economic competition in wealthy societies, untouched.

This is a genuine philosophical challenge. The governed outcome (+5) represents the best version of this scenario, which may still involve significant positional competition even if material needs are met.

**Key tension:** The technology for material abundance may arrive decades before the political institutions capable of distributing it.
