summary: "Functional immortality through digital substrate, possibly grounded in a philosophical error about consciousness."
---

Human consciousness transferred to digital substrate - functional immortality. The technical requirements are staggering: scanning the brain at sufficient resolution to capture dynamic state, modeling computations that produce consciousness, running that model on hardware sustaining subjective experience. The philosophical challenges may be harder still. Is the upload *you*, or a copy that thinks it's you? Functionalists say if computation is preserved, the person is preserved. Embodiment theorists say consciousness depends on biological substrate in ways computation cannot capture. The question determines whether mind uploading is immortality or sophisticated suicide.

If achieved, every framework we use to organize society changes: death becomes optional, population becomes a policy variable, and law and morality must be rebuilt from their foundations.

**Key tension:** The most personally consequential technology imaginable, possibly grounded in a philosophical error about the nature of consciousness.
