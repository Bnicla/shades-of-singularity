Personalized AI creates not merely filter bubbles but comprehensive, individually tailored reality-tunnels - personalized news, science, history, morality. Consensus reality ceases to exist. Political polarization accelerates into political speciation: populations that cannot agree on what *happened*, what *exists*, what *is true*. The common referents that make a society a society dissolve into individually optimized simulations.

The governance challenge is severe because personalization genuinely serves human needs - people learn better with tailored information. The pathology is not in personalization itself but in personalization without a shared epistemic floor. Building that floor requires content provenance standards, public media, shared educational foundations, and civic rituals of collective sense-making. Even so, the governed outcome is a modest 0 - merely neutral - because even the best governance can only partially counteract the centrifugal force of individually optimized information.

**Key tension:** Personalization serves genuine needs while destroying the shared epistemic commons.
