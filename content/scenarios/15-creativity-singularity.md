When AI composes symphonies, writes novels, and generates scientific hypotheses at superhuman quality and infinite volume, the cultural meaning of human creative expression enters crisis. Three responses are already visible: denial (insisting AI cannot "truly" create); integration (AI as creative partner); and retreat (provably human-made art valued for its limitation and mortality). Each has historical precedent - the Arts and Crafts movement responded similarly to industrialization.

Unmanaged, this is a cultural loss (-1) rather than catastrophe. Governed, it becomes +3 - AI democratizes creative tools, enabling billions who never had access to training or studios to express themselves. The governed future is one where the *means* of creation become universal while the *meaning* of creation evolves. This is the terrain the author explores in the novella *The Edge of the Chisel* - whether the sculptor's struggle is essential to the sculpture.

**Key tension:** AI may *expand* creative possibility while *destroying* the cultural framework that gives creativity meaning.
