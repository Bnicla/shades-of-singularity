Global data center electricity consumption reached approximately 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024, about 1.5% of global electricity demand, growing at 12% annually over five years. The IEA projects this will more than double to 945 TWh by 2030, roughly equivalent to Japan's entire electricity consumption. AI is the primary driver: electricity demand from AI-optimized data centers is projected to more than quadruple by 2030. In the United States, data center power consumption is on course to account for nearly half of electricity demand growth between now and 2030. The U.S. economy is set to consume more electricity for processing data in 2030 than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, and chemicals ([IEA, Energy and AI, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai); [Pew Research, 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/24/what-we-know-about-energy-use-at-us-data-centers-amid-the-ai-boom/)).

The concentration creates localized strain. In Virginia, data centers already consume 26% of electricity. In Dublin, the figure is 79%. A Carnegie Mellon study estimates data centers and cryptocurrency mining could lead to an 8% increase in the average U.S. electricity bill by 2030, potentially exceeding 25% in northern Virginia. The water footprint is equally severe: data centers require enormous volumes for cooling, and in drought-prone regions the competition with residential and agricultural use is already producing political conflict. A Google data center in The Dalles, Oregon consumed over a quarter of the city's water supply. Goldman Sachs forecasts data center demand to grow by about 50% to 92 GW by 2027, with construction spending in the U.S. tripled in three years ([Goldman Sachs, 2025](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-ai-is-transforming-data-centers-and-ramping-up-power-demand); [Carbon Brief, 2025](https://www.carbonbrief.org/ai-five-charts-that-put-data-centre-energy-use-and-emissions-into-context/)).

The scale argument pushes back hard. The IEA estimates data center emissions will reach only about 1% of global CO2 by 2030, and the increase in data center electricity demand (530 TWh) is less than the growth from electric vehicles (838 TWh) or air conditioning (651 TWh). AI is also the most powerful tool available for climate optimization: modeling climate systems, discovering materials for energy storage, optimizing power grids, monitoring deforestation. Efficiency gains are real. Between 2015 and 2019, data center workloads tripled while power consumption stayed roughly flat.

The governed outcome (+3) reflects the potential for regulation to force the industry toward renewable energy, water efficiency, and algorithmic optimization while preserving AI's environmental benefits. The unmanaged outcome (-3) reflects the alternative: exponential growth in energy demand, predominantly fossil-fuel-generated, in the countries where data centers are most concentrated.

**Key tension:** AI could be the key to solving climate change or the force that makes it materially harder. The difference depends on whether the industry's environmental costs are internalized or externalized.
