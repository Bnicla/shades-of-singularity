Hamilton was obsessed with foreign influence on the republic. Federalist 68 is specifically about preventing foreign powers from installing a preferred president. AI enables this threat at unprecedented scale and subtlety: not crude election interference but continuous, personalized manipulation of civic discourse, tailored to individual psychological vulnerabilities, delivered through channels indistinguishable from organic conversation, at the cost of a few servers. A foreign power need not hack an election if it can shape what every voter believes in the months before they cast a ballot.

The attack surface is total. AI can generate millions of unique, psychologically targeted messages - no two alike, each optimized for its recipient. It can simulate grassroots movements, manufacture consensus, amplify division, and erode trust in institutions - not through obvious propaganda but through a steady, invisible corrosion of the information environment. Detection is nearly impossible because the content is not false in any easily identifiable way; it is *selectively true*, framed to manipulate rather than inform. The threat Hamilton feared most was the corruption of civic judgment, and AI makes that corruption scalable.

**Key tension:** The openness that makes democratic discourse possible is the same vulnerability that makes it exploitable.
