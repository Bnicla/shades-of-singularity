summary: "When AI \"customers\" shape products and AI \"employees\" perform services, market signals stop reflecting human needs."
---

AI agents already trade stocks, negotiate prices, generate content, and provide services. As they become more capable, they will constitute an increasing fraction of market participants. When AI shapes demand signals, performs labor, and allocates capital, the conceptual framework of economics, built on assumptions about human preferences and needs, breaks down. Market signals become unreliable because they no longer reflect human desires. The economy becomes efficient by every traditional metric while becoming increasingly disconnected from the people it ostensibly serves.

This is already visible in financial markets, where algorithmic trading generates approximately 60 to 75% of all U.S. equity volume, a market valued at over $50 billion in 2024 and projected to nearly triple by 2033 ([Coherent Market Insights, 2025](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/algorithmic-trading-market-2476); [Straits Research, 2025](https://straitsresearch.com/report/algorithmic-trading-market)). The algorithms are not merely executing human decisions faster. An NBER working paper by Dou, Goldstein, and Ji (2025) demonstrated through simulation experiments that AI-powered trading agents using reinforcement learning autonomously sustain collusive supra-competitive profits without any agreement, communication, or intent. The algorithms converge on behaviors that reduce market liquidity, decrease price informativeness, and increase mispricing, all while each agent independently optimizes its own returns. This is not a theoretical concern. The researchers characterize two distinct mechanisms through which AI collusion arises and show that it falls outside existing antitrust enforcement rules, which require evidence of communication to prove conspiracy ([NBER, 2025](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34054)). Separate research presented at the American Economic Association (2025) extended the finding to LLM-based pricing agents, showing that even when given "seemingly innocuous instructions in broad lay terms," they quickly arrive at supracompetitive price levels. The authors note a paradox: public antitrust research documenting algorithmic collusion may itself enter LLM training data, inadvertently teaching future pricing agents the strategies it describes ([AEA, 2025](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2025/program/paper/GDskRTN3)).

The real-world legal response has begun. California enacted AB 325, making it unlawful to use or distribute a common pricing algorithm as part of a restraint of trade. New York passed algorithmic pricing disclosure requirements. Seattle and San Francisco banned algorithmic rent-setting tools. In the Duffy v. Yardi case, a court found that landlords using the same AI pricing tool could form a conspiracy even without direct communication. October 2025 brought a class action against Optimal Blue and 26 major mortgage lenders, alleging the company's software enabled rate-fixing that inflated costs for millions of homebuyers ([DLA Piper, 2025](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2025/11/antitrust-and-ai-plaintiffs-enforcers-and-legislatures-take-aim-at-alleged-ai-driven-collusion)). The pattern is consistent: when competing firms independently adopt the same pricing algorithm, the market settles on prices higher than competition would produce. Consumers rarely notice small increases, but across millions of transactions the microadjustments accumulate into a structural transfer of wealth ([Michigan Journal of Economics, 2025](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2025/11/17/algorithmic-pricing-colluding-without-breaking-the-rules/)).

The agent economy is scaling beyond finance. IBM and Salesforce estimate that over one billion AI agents will be in operation worldwide by the end of 2026. The global AI agents market, valued at $5.4 billion in 2024, is projected to reach $236 billion by 2034. By Black Friday 2025, AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites had risen 805% year-over-year, with agents driving over $22 billion in global online sales. The WEF observes that "a growing share of customers won't be humans at all" as consumer AI agents begin autonomously booking travel, negotiating prices, and completing purchases ([WEF, January 2026](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/ai-agents-trust/)). Gartner predicts that 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025 ([Machine Learning Mastery, 2026](https://machinelearningmastery.com/7-agentic-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2026/)). When an AI agent representing a buyer negotiates with an AI agent representing a seller, the "market transaction" reflects the training objectives and optimization targets of both systems, not the preferences of the humans who nominally authorized them.

Meanwhile, the internet itself is becoming a synthetic environment. The Imperva Bad Bot Report (2025) found that automated bot traffic surpassed human-generated traffic for the first time, constituting 51% of all web activity in 2024, with bad bots alone accounting for 37%. An Ahrefs analysis of nearly a million web pages published in April 2025 found that 74.2% contained detectable AI-generated content ([Imperva/Thales, 2025](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/about-us/newsroom/2025-imperva-bad-bot-report-ai-internet-traffic); [Fortune, 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/07/22/is-artificial-intelligence-ai-bubble-bots-over-50-percent-internet/)). Bot-inflated metrics, including pageviews, clicks, session durations, and user sign-ups, distort the business data on which tech company valuations depend. Fortune described the dynamic bluntly: the AI boom may be "built on the backs of bots, maybe more than real users." When bots generate the traffic, AI generates the content, and algorithms set the prices, the feedback loops of the digital economy increasingly run machine-to-machine, with human participation becoming optional at every stage.

None of this is entirely new. Corporations are non-human entities that have long been market actors. Advertising has shaped demand for over a century. Algorithmic trading has dominated equity volume for a decade. California's AB 325, the RealPage lawsuits, and emerging "personhood verification" requirements for consequential transactions demonstrate that legal systems can respond to each new iteration.

What is new is the convergence. When the majority of web traffic is non-human, when three-quarters of new web content is AI-generated, when pricing algorithms converge on supra-competitive outcomes without any human directing them to do so, the economic concept of a "market" as a mechanism for aggregating human preferences begins to lose its descriptive accuracy. Addressing this requires legal regimes distinguishing human from AI market participants, mandatory disclosure of algorithmic pricing inputs, and economic metrics designed for a hybrid human-AI economy. The antitrust system, built to detect communication between human conspirators, needs fundamental revision to address coordination that emerges from independent optimization.

**Key tension:** The economy becomes more "productive" by every traditional measure while becoming less about humans. The metrics improve as the underlying reality they were designed to measure dissolves.
