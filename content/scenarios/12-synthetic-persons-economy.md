summary: "When AI \"customers\" shape products and AI \"employees\" perform services, market signals stop reflecting human needs."
---

AI agents already trade stocks, negotiate prices, generate content, and provide services. As they become more capable, they will constitute an increasing fraction of market participants. When AI shapes demand signals, performs labor, and allocates capital, the conceptual framework of economics, built on assumptions about human preferences and needs, breaks down. Market signals become unreliable because they no longer reflect human desires. The economy becomes efficient by every traditional metric while becoming increasingly disconnected from the people it ostensibly serves.

This is already visible in financial markets, where algorithmic trading constitutes the majority of volume. It is emerging in content markets, where AI-generated material increasingly shapes what humans see. The extension to consumer markets, healthcare decisions, and resource allocation follows from current trajectories.

Markets have always involved intermediaries, and the precedents are worth considering. Corporations are non-human entities that have long been market actors. Advertising has shaped demand rather than reflecting it for over a century. The addition of AI agents is a change of degree, and existing consumer protection frameworks can adapt.

The response: the change of degree may cross a threshold. When the majority of market signals originate from non-human actors, price discovery loses its informational justification. The response requires legal frameworks for non-human economic agents, "personhood verification" for consequential transactions, and economic metrics designed for a hybrid human-AI economy.

**Key tension:** The economy becomes more "productive" by every traditional measure while becoming less about humans.
