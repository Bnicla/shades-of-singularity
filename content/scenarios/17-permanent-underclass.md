Scenarios 1 and 2 document the mechanisms: labor displacement, capital concentration, platform dependency. This scenario asks a different question. At what point do those dynamics become irreversible?

Inequality is a condition. Caste is a structure. The difference is whether the people at the bottom can plausibly reach the top. Nick Bostrom projects that under full automation, the factor share of capital approaches 100% of world product. The remainder of the population becomes structurally superfluous. The enhanced class out-thinks the underclass in every domain. Bostrom's vision of a post-transition Malthusian state, where impoverished rentiers reduce metabolic costs because even subsistence becomes unaffordable, follows logically from unrestrained automation without redistribution. But the endpoint is less important than the threshold. What matters is the moment when the feedback loops close and the exits seal shut.

The first lock is capital compounding. An IMF working paper published in April 2025 ([Rockall, Tavares, and Pizzinelli](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729)) found that while AI may reduce wage inequality by displacing high-income workers, it "always" increases wealth inequality, in every scenario modeled, because displaced high-income workers are better positioned to benefit from rising capital returns. They own the assets whose value AI inflates. The workers below them do not. The model predicts a wealth Gini increase of over 7 percentage points under baseline AI adoption. The mechanism is simple: wages can equalize downward while wealth diverges upward. You can flatten everyone's paycheck and still watch the ownership class pull away, because wealth generates returns and returns generate wealth. A separate study in the *Bulletin of the World Health Organization* ([Occhipinti et al., 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774225/)) proposes the existence of an AI-capital-to-labor ratio threshold beyond which a self-reinforcing recessionary cycle emerges that market forces alone cannot correct. The question is whether we have already crossed it.

The second lock is mobility collapse. Raj Chetty's research at Harvard, published in *Science* ([Chetty et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4617)), showed that 92% of American children born in 1940 grew up to earn more than their parents. For children born in 1984, the figure was 50%. Two-thirds of the decline was attributable to unequal distribution of growth, not slower growth itself ([Equitable Growth, 2019](https://equitablegrowth.org/to-fight-falling-u-s-intergenerational-mobility-tackle-economic-inequality/)). AI accelerates the distributional skew that drove the collapse. The traditional escape route, education, is breaking down. Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology [found that technical skills](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-and-the-future-of-workforce-training/) now become outdated in less than five years on average, while AI, unlike previous technology waves, disrupts both blue-collar and white-collar workers simultaneously. The retraining system that is supposed to catch displaced workers has a dismal evidence base. Julian Jacobs at Brookings [reviewed the record in May 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ai-labor-displacement-and-the-limits-of-worker-retraining/) and found that the National JTPA Study, a genuine randomized controlled trial, showed no statistically significant improvement in employment or earnings for participants. The U.S. spends [approximately 0.1% of GDP](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/should-the-federal-government-spend-more-on-workforce-development/) on active labor market policies, second-to-last among OECD countries. When the ladder is broken and the replacement ladder does not work, the people at the bottom stay at the bottom.

The third lock is cognitive asymmetry. The standard counterargument is that AI tools are cheap. A $20 subscription provides analytical capacity previously available only to expensive consultants. Open-source models are free. This has real force on the access side. It has less force on the compounding side. A $20 subscription and a $200 subscription already access meaningfully different capabilities. Enterprise clients get custom-trained models, proprietary integrations, and AI agents embedded across their operations. The gap between consumer AI and corporate AI is not narrowing. It is widening into tiers: free users with ads and usage caps, professionals with mid-range subscriptions, and organizations with dedicated infrastructure that learns from their specific workflows. The person using free-tier AI to write a resume is not competing on equal cognitive footing with the firm using enterprise AI to screen ten thousand resumes per hour. You can have a smartphone and still be structurally poor. You can have ChatGPT and still be structurally outmatched.

The cognitive gap compounds across generations. Children in wealthier households get AI tutoring calibrated to their learning pace, health monitoring, and career optimization. Children in poorer households get whatever the free tier provides. Chetty's research established that neighborhood and environment are the strongest determinants of economic mobility. AI adds a new layer of environmental advantage. It follows children through screens. The enrichment spending gap between high-income and low-income families was already widening before AI. AI does not close it. It digitizes it and accelerates it.

The fourth lock is political capture. When the enhanced class accumulates enough wealth and intelligence to shape the rules governing both, redistribution becomes structurally impossible. Scenario 2 documents the lobbying data. What matters here is the implication: the window for policy intervention is not indefinite. Every year that concentration deepens without redistribution makes future redistribution harder, because the concentrated class gains more power to prevent it. This is the feudal parallel. Aristocracies did not merely possess wealth. They wrote the laws that perpetuated their possession. The transition from inequality to caste is the transition from "the rules could be changed" to "the people who benefit from the rules control the rulemaking."

Daron Acemoglu, the 2024 Nobel laureate in economics, provides the historical frame. In a [January 2025 lecture at the University of Zurich](https://www.ubscenter.uzh.ch/en/news_events/insights/2025-02-daron_acemoglu_artificial_intelligence.html), he noted that benefits from the British Industrial Revolution took more than 100 years to diffuse to workers. Three generations lived and died in immiseration before institutional pressure forced redistribution. Acemoglu and Johnson's *[Power and Progress](https://news.mit.edu/2023/power-and-progress-book-ai-inequality-0517)* (2023) documents that diffusion was never automatic. It was fought for, through labor movements, antitrust action, progressive taxation, and public investment. The question is whether those fights are being fought now. The current evidence, documented across the first two scenarios, suggests they are not.

The 6-point governance dividend reflects enormous policy power. Universal AI access, progressive taxation of AI-generated wealth, public ownership stakes in frontier systems, and sustained social investment could prevent lock-in. These are the same mechanisms that diffused the gains of every prior general-purpose technology. The difference is speed. Previous technologies gave societies decades to organize responses. AI capability is compounding on timescales of months. The window between "inequality that policy can reverse" and "caste that policy cannot reach" may be shorter than any previous transition has allowed.

**Key tension:** Every lock described above is currently tightening. None is yet fully closed. The scenario's likelihood depends entirely on whether institutional counterforce materializes before the feedback loops become self-sustaining. The governed outcome requires acting in a window whose duration no one can measure and whose closing no one will announce.
