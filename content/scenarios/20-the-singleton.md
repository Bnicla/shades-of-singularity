---

One entity - corporation, government, or AI itself - achieves such decisive advantage that it can establish permanent, unchallengeable global control. Not necessarily through military force; it simply outthinks all adversaries in every domain simultaneously. A well-aligned, democratically accountable singleton could be the best global government in history. An authoritarian or misaligned one could be the most total and permanent tyranny - a dictatorship with no possibility of revolution.

The 9-point dividend means the institutional choices made now - which nations lead development, under what frameworks, with what accountability - determine the character of any future singleton. Hamilton, who designed institutions to survive imperfect leaders, would argue the singleton must be constitutionalized before it is created.

**Key tension:** A benevolent singleton might be the best possible outcome; a malevolent one, the worst.
