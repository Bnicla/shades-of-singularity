AI lowers the expertise threshold for mass destruction. RAND's 2025 analysis concluded that while AI alone is unlikely to cause extinction, it could enable previously incapable actors to create catastrophic threats. The most concerning domain is bioweapons: AI can assist in designing novel pathogens and circumventing defenses in ways that once required deep laboratory expertise. Bostrom's "vulnerable world hypothesis" applies: as capabilities become accessible, the number of actors capable of civilizational-scale damage grows.

The governance dividend is modest (3 points) because even effective governance can only reduce probability, not eliminate it. As with nuclear proliferation, perfect security is impossible - the goal is to make catastrophic misuse difficult and detectable.

**Key tension:** The same openness that drives AI innovation distributes dangerous capabilities.
