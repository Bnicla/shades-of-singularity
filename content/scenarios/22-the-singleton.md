One entity, whether a corporation, government, or AI itself, achieves such decisive advantage that it can establish permanent, unchallengeable global control. The mechanism need not be military force; it simply outthinks all adversaries in every domain simultaneously. Aschenbrenner's ["Situational Awareness"](https://situational-awareness.ai/) (2024) argues this is the default trajectory: whichever nation or entity first achieves superintelligence gains a decisive strategic advantage, and the U.S. government will inevitably nationalize the project once its implications become clear. A well-aligned, democratically accountable singleton could be the best global governance ever achieved. An authoritarian or misaligned one could be the most total and permanent tyranny.

The 9-point dividend means the institutional choices made now, which nations lead development, under what frameworks, with what accountability, determine the character of any future singleton. The argument for constitutionalizing AI governance before a singleton emerges is analogous to writing a constitution before a government takes power: constraints are easier to impose before the entity they constrain exists.

The adversarial point: the singleton scenario assumes a winner-take-all dynamic that competitive markets, geopolitical competition, and open-source development all work against. The AI landscape is becoming more distributed, not more concentrated. DeepSeek demonstrated that frontier capabilities can be achieved at a fraction of the expected cost. If AI development continues to be multipolar, the singleton scenario recedes.

This is the strongest objection. The response: the key variable is whether AI advantage compounds faster than it diffuses. If a decisive lead in capability creates a self-reinforcing advantage (through data access, compute access, or recursive improvement), multipolarity is temporary.

**Key tension:** A benevolent singleton might be the best possible outcome; a malevolent one, the worst. Whether AI development is naturally monopolistic or naturally competitive is an open empirical question.
