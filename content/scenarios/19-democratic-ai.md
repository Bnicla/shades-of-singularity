This is a prescription, not a prediction. AI capability treated as public infrastructure: universally accessible, publicly funded, democratically governed. Every citizen has access to equivalent AI tools regardless of income. AI enhances democratic participation through informed voting, transparent governance, and citizen deliberation at scale. Power concentration is prevented through structural regulation.

The model is public education, extended to artificial intelligence. The conviction that an informed citizenry is the only safeguard of liberty applies with greater force when the tools of intelligence are artificially created and distributable. The likelihood is low because it requires overcoming the very power concentrations other scenarios describe. This is the hardest scenario to achieve and the most consequential to miss.

The adversarial point: "democratic AI" as public infrastructure faces the same problems as other public goods. Government-run AI would be slower, less capable, and more bureaucratic than private alternatives. It would be subject to political interference. The history of public technology programs (government email systems, public broadband) suggests they underperform market alternatives. The best route to universal access may be cheap private AI, which is already emerging, rather than a public utility model.

This criticism has force. The response is that access to tools differs from democratic governance of the infrastructure. You can have cheap private AI and still face the power concentration problems other scenarios describe. The prescription is about governance, not delivery mechanism.

**Key tension:** Requires unprecedented coordination and willingness to constrain corporate power at the moment of its greatest leverage.
