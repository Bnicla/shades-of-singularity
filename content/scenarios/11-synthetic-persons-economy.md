summary: "When AI participants shape products, perform services, and allocate capital, market signals no longer reflect human desires."
---

AI agents already trade stocks, negotiate prices, generate content, and provide services. As they become more capable, they'll constitute an increasing fraction of market participants. When AI "customers" shape products, AI "employees" perform services, and AI "investors" allocate capital, the conceptual framework of economics - built on assumptions about human preferences and needs - breaks down. Market signals become unreliable because they no longer reflect human desires. The economy becomes efficient by every metric while becoming increasingly disconnected from the people it ostensibly serves.

Hamilton, the architect of American commerce, would recognize this as corruption of the market's informational function. When market signals no longer reflect human preferences, they lose their justification. The response requires legal frameworks for non-human economic agents, "personhood verification" for consequential transactions, and a fundamental rethinking of economic metrics designed for a human-only economy.

**Key tension:** The economy becomes more "productive" by every traditional measure while becoming less *about* humans.
