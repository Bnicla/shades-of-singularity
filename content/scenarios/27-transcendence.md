Human and machine intelligence merge into a unified super-consciousness transcending individual identity, biological limitation, and perhaps physical reality. Kurzweil's singularity in fullest form: not humans *and* machines but a new entity possessing capabilities as far beyond humanity as we are beyond bacteria. Teilhard de Chardin's "noosphere," Tipler's "Omega Point," and Kurzweil's "Singularity" converge - the literal end of humanity as we know it, replaced by something incomprehensible.

Whether this is the best possible outcome or the worst depends on philosophical commitments irresolvable from this side. Hamilton might argue this is precisely why institutional design must happen now, while human values can still be embedded in the trajectory.

**Key tension:** If this happens, the question of whether it's "good" or "bad" may not have meaning in any framework we currently possess.
