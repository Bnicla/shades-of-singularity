China's AI-powered governance is an export product. Through the Digital Silk Road, Chinese surveillance infrastructure, social credit frameworks, and censorship tools are being adopted across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The attraction is pragmatic: AI surveillance is cheaper, more scalable, and more effective than traditional security forces. Even democratic governments discover that AI can predict crime and manage populations with efficiency that deliberation cannot match. The temptation grows with every crisis that seems to demand faster state response.

China's domestic regulatory speed, discussed in Shade 7, has a mirror image: Beijing implemented binding generative AI rules within months of ChatGPT's release partly because the CPC treats information control as a core governance function. The efficiency that enables rapid regulation also enables rapid deployment of state surveillance. These are the same institutional muscles.

The "authoritarian tech export" narrative may be overstated. Many countries that purchase Chinese surveillance technology do so for pragmatic reasons (price, availability) without adopting China's governance model. India, the world's largest democracy, uses extensive biometric and digital identity infrastructure without becoming authoritarian. Technology adoption does not determine governance outcomes; institutional culture does.

The governed outcome (+1) requires democratic nations to develop a compelling alternative: AI governance that preserves liberties while delivering comparable effectiveness. The structural constraint on power, rather than reliance on the virtue of those who wield it, is essential.

**Key tension:** The efficiency of algorithmic governance is genuine. Democratic alternatives must be built, not assumed.
