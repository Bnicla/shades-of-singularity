Personalized AI creates comprehensive, individually tailored reality-tunnels: personalized news, science, history, morality. Consensus reality ceases to exist. Political polarization accelerates into political speciation: populations that cannot agree on what happened, what exists, what is true. The common referents that make a society a society dissolve into individually optimized simulations.

This is an extension of dynamics already visible in social media. The difference is scale and seamlessness. A personalized AI assistant that curates your information environment is qualitatively different from a news feed algorithm. It is a trusted intermediary that shapes what you see and how you think about what you see.

People have always lived in different information environments, and this perspective deserves consideration. In the 19th century, a farmer in Kansas and a banker in Manhattan shared almost no informational common ground. Mass media created shared reality; its decline returns us to a historical norm. The "shared epistemic commons" may be a brief historical anomaly of the broadcast era, and its loss, while concerning for democratic governance, may not be the catastrophe it appears from within that anomaly.

The governance challenge is severe because personalization serves real human needs. People learn better with tailored information. The pathology is in personalization without a shared epistemic floor. Building that floor requires content provenance standards, public media, shared educational foundations, and civic rituals of collective sense-making. Even so, the governed outcome is a modest 0 because even the best governance can only partially counteract the centrifugal force of individually optimized information.

**Key tension:** The shared reality that democracy requires may have been a product of specific media technologies rather than a durable feature of human societies.
