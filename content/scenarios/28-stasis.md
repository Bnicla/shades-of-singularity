Despite all predictions, AI capabilities plateau short of superintelligence. Scaling laws hit fundamental limits. Deep learning proves powerful but narrow - brilliant at pattern matching, incapable of genuine reasoning or recursive self-improvement. A recent analysis in a leading physics journal found the current AI wave may follow logistic rather than exponential growth, saturating around 2035-2040. The singularity joins fusion and flying cars as perpetually twenty years away.

This is the most comforting scenario and therefore the most dangerous. If taken as grounds for complacency, it allows Tier 1 harms - labor displacement, power concentration, surveillance, epistemic collapse - to proceed without response. Hamilton's argument does not depend on the singularity arriving. It depends on the changes already underway demanding institutional response.

**Key tension:** The most comforting scenario may also be the most dangerous - breeding complacency about real but sub-catastrophic AI harms.
