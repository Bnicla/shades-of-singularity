Brain-computer interfaces, neuropharmacology, genetic editing, and AI-augmented cognition converge to create fundamentally enhanced human intelligence. Neuralink-type devices, initially medical, expand into cognitive augmentation: enhanced memory, accelerated processing, direct knowledge access. If available only to the wealthy, the result is a new species divide - Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens augmentus, differing not in wealth but in the fundamental capacity for thought. The unaugmented may find enhanced humans as incomprehensible as we find other primates.

This has the highest governance dividend after the intelligence explosion: 7 points. Universal cognitive enhancement would be the greatest equalizer in history. Restricted enhancement would be the greatest divider. The policy choices of the next two decades - IP law, healthcare policy, public investment, international access - determine which materializes. Hamilton would argue for cognitive enhancement as a public right, analogous to public education: the republic cannot survive if only the wealthy can think.

**Key tension:** Could be the greatest equalizer in history or the greatest divider - the difference is policy.
