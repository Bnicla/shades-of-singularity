summary: "Differential access to AI creates a new cognitive caste system that compounds over time."
---

Differential access to AI capabilities will create a new axis of social stratification. Those with access to frontier AI systems will enjoy cognitive advantages - in education, work, health, legal, and financial decisions - that compound over time, creating a self-reinforcing caste system based on AI access rather than traditional markers of class.
