summary: "When AI can do everything better, the question shifts from survival to purpose."

Even if economics are managed - even if UBI prevents starvation - a deeper wound remains. When AI can write, create, diagnose, advise, and strategize better than any human, the question shifts from "how will we survive?" to "why do we matter?" Work provides not just income but identity, structure, social connection, and purpose - what Jahoda called the "latent functions of employment." When those functions are stripped away, not by unemployment but by the knowledge that a machine does your work better, the psychological consequences are severe: depression, anomie, addiction, radicalization.

This scenario has no obvious policy lever. You cannot legislate meaning. But you can build institutions that cultivate it: education systems emphasizing uniquely human capacities (embodiment, relationship, moral judgment, care); cultural frameworks valuing process over product; economic structures rewarding engagement rather than output. A republic of citizens who believe their contributions are meaningless will not defend their republic.

**Key tension:** Some populations may thrive in post-work creative leisure; others may suffer precisely the loss of structured meaning that employment provided.
