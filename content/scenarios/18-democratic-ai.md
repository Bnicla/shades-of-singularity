Not a prediction but a prescription. AI capability treated as public infrastructure: universally accessible, publicly funded, democratically governed. Every citizen has access to equivalent AI tools regardless of income. AI enhances democratic participation - informed voting, transparent governance, citizen deliberation at scale. Power concentration is prevented through structural regulation.

The model is public education - Hamilton's conviction that an informed citizenry is the only safeguard of liberty, extended to artificial intelligence. The likelihood is low not because it's technically impossible but because it requires overcoming the very power concentrations other scenarios describe. This is the scenario whose absence makes every other scenario worse.

**Key tension:** Requires unprecedented coordination and willingness to constrain corporate power at the moment of its greatest leverage.
