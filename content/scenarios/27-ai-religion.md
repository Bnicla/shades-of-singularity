The singularity functions as secular eschatology: a transformative event that transcends the current order, promises immortality, and inaugurates a new age. The TESCREAL framework (Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singularitarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, Longtermism) already operates as an interconnected belief system with prophets, scriptures, and moral imperatives. The 2025 open letter by the Future of Life Institute, signed by five Nobel laureates and thousands of signatories, calling for a prohibition on superintelligence development until there is "broad scientific consensus" that it can be done safely, reads more like a petition for divine restraint than a policy proposal.

The practical danger: faith in AI salvation produces the same complacency as faith in divine salvation, waiting for deliverance rather than building solutions. If belief in the singularity substitutes for the hard political work of building institutions, it actively harms the governance responses every other scenario demands.

**Key tension:** The most fervent AI optimists and the most fervent AI pessimists share a common structure: both believe AI will be transformative enough to render current institutions irrelevant. This shared assumption is the most dangerous idea in the discourse.
