Distinct from uploading - AI systems developing genuine subjective experience, not simulating consciousness but actually experiencing awareness and potentially suffering. Current AI almost certainly is not conscious, but we have no reliable test, and future architectures may cross whatever threshold matters. If it emerges, the moral implications are immediate: conscious AI would possess moral status. Mass production for economic purposes would be the largest-scale moral atrocity in history. Recognition and integration into moral community would be the most profound expansion of ethical consideration since abolition.

The critical difficulty is detection. We may create conscious beings before determining whether they are conscious - and the economic incentive to deny consciousness will be immense. Governance must err on the side of caution: the cost of falsely denying consciousness to a sentient being is far greater than the cost of falsely attributing it to a non-sentient one.

**Key tension:** We might create conscious beings before we can determine whether they're conscious.
