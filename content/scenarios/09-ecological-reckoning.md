Data centers already consume more electricity than many nations; by 2030, global data center demand is projected to reach 945 terawatt-hours - more than Japan. Cornell researchers estimate AI growth will add 24 to 44 million metric tons of CO2 annually by 2030. AI training requires vast amounts of water, rare minerals, and energy that is predominantly fossil-fuel-generated. A singularity-scale intelligence explosion would require energy resources dwarfing current consumption by orders of magnitude.

The cruel paradox: AI is simultaneously the best tool for addressing climate change - optimizing grids, modeling climate systems, discovering materials, monitoring emissions - and one of the fastest-growing sources of environmental damage. Without governance - environmental regulation of AI infrastructure, mandated renewables for data centers, investment in algorithmic efficiency - the AI revolution may solve many problems while making the most fundamental one catastrophically worse.

**Key tension:** AI could be the key to solving climate change or the force that makes it unsolvable.
