Even if economics are managed and UBI prevents starvation, a deeper wound remains. Work provides identity, structure, social connection, and purpose: what Marie Jahoda called the "latent functions of employment" in her foundational 1982 research on unemployment's psychological effects. Recent research confirms the pattern holds for AI-driven displacement specifically. A 2025 Frontiers in Psychology study identified "algorithmic anxiety" as a distinct syndrome encompassing fears of job loss, identity erosion, and existential questions about human value in an automated future ([Frontiers in Psychology, 2026](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1745164/full)). A PMC study of Indian IT professionals found that technology-induced displacement triggers higher psychological distress than traditional layoffs, because the loss feels permanent and inevitable ([PMC, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12409910/)). In India, where 68% of white-collar workers fear their roles could be automated within five years, job identity is tightly linked to personal and familial pride; displacement triggers social withdrawal and internalized shame.

The World Economic Forum's Global Foresight Network has identified occupational identity loss as a real global risk, with 41% of employers intending to reduce their workforce by 2030 due to AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within one to four years. The IMF estimates 60% of jobs in advanced economies are already exposed ([WEF, 2025](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/the-overlooked-global-risk-of-the-ai-precariat/)).

Humans have survived previous meaning crises, and the precedents are worth examining. Industrialization, the decline of religion, the shift from agrarian to urban life all disrupted identity structures. People adapted. Retirement does not routinely produce mass despair. Retirees with sufficient resources and social connection generally thrive. Dario Amodei's October 2024 essay "Machines of Loving Grace" makes the most detailed case for optimism: freed from survival-based labor, humanity could redirect toward creativity, connection, and self-actualization. Anthropic's own January 2026 Economic Index suggests the current moment remains largely augmentation rather than displacement, with most AI usage supporting rather than replacing human cognitive work. The key variable may be economic security and community, which are policy-solvable, rather than some inherent need for economically productive labor.

This is partly right. The governed outcome (+2) depends on building institutions that cultivate meaning: education systems emphasizing embodiment, relationship, moral judgment, and care; cultural frameworks valuing process over product; economic structures rewarding engagement rather than output. The difference between this transition and retirement is that retirement is a socially recognized life stage with established scripts. Mass displacement of working-age adults has no script. The psychological infrastructure does not exist and must be built.

**Key tension:** Some populations may thrive in post-work creative leisure; others may suffer precisely the loss of structured meaning that employment provided. The difference is likely to track existing inequalities.
