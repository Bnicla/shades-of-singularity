China's AI-powered governance is an export product. Through the Digital Silk Road, Chinese surveillance infrastructure, social credit frameworks, and censorship tools are adopted across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The attraction is pragmatic, not ideological: AI surveillance is cheaper, more scalable, and more effective than traditional security forces. Even democratic governments discover AI can predict crime and manage populations with efficiency that deliberation cannot match. The temptation grows with every crisis that seems to demand faster state response.

The governed outcome (+1) requires democratic nations to develop a compelling alternative: AI governance that preserves liberties while delivering comparable effectiveness. This is extraordinarily difficult - which is why Hamilton's instinct for structural constraints on power, rather than reliance on the virtue of those who wield it, is essential.

**Key tension:** Even democratic societies may drift toward algorithmic governance not through tyranny but through convenience.
