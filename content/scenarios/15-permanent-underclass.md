If AI wealth concentrates and is not redistributed, the economy bifurcates permanently. Nick Bostrom projects that under full automation, the factor share of capital approaches 100% of world product. The remainder of the population becomes structurally superfluous. This goes beyond inequality into caste. The enhanced class out-thinks the underclass in every domain. Bostrom's vision of a post-transition Malthusian state, where impoverished rentiers reduce metabolic costs because even subsistence becomes unaffordable, follows logically from unrestrained automation without redistribution.

Historical predictions of permanent stratification from new technology have consistently been wrong. The printing press, electricity, the internet, and mobile computing all initially concentrated advantages before diffusing broadly. AI tools are already cheap: a $20 subscription provides analytical capacity previously available only to expensive consultants. Open-source models are free. The cost curve for AI capability is falling rapidly, which works against permanent exclusion. Acemoglu and Johnson's *Power and Progress* (2023) provides the strongest academic framework here: technology has historically benefited the many only when institutions actively redirected its gains, through labor movements, antitrust action, progressive taxation, and public investment. The diffusion was never automatic. It was fought for.

This has real force on the tools side. It has less force on the capital side. If AI-driven productivity gains flow primarily to capital owners, cheap AI access does not prevent economic bifurcation. You can have a smartphone and still be structurally poor. The 6-point dividend reflects enormous policy leverage. Universal AI access, progressive taxation of AI-generated wealth, public ownership stakes in frontier systems, and robust social investment could flip this outcome. The question is entirely political.

**Key tension:** The owners of AI gain more than money; they gain access to fundamentally different levels of intelligence and capability. Whether that advantage diffuses or entrenches depends on policy choices being made now.
