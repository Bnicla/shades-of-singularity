AI accelerates everything except the institutions designed to govern it. Legislative processes that take months confront capabilities that emerge in weeks. Courts deliberating for years adjudicate technologies that transform monthly. Regulatory agencies staffed for the previous era face an industry that outpaces them in talent, information, and speed by orders of magnitude. The Constitution was designed for the tempo of horseback couriers; AI operates at the speed of light.

Hamilton worried constantly about whether republican government could act with sufficient "energy" and "dispatch" - the central argument of Federalist 70. AI doesn't just outpace regulation; it may render the entire architecture of deliberative governance structurally incapable of response. This is distinct from Digital Authoritarianism (#13), which concerns *bad* governance. This concerns *good* governance becoming too slow to matter. The most well-intentioned legislature, the most principled judiciary, the most competent regulatory body may simply be unable to keep pace with a technology that evolves faster than any institution designed for human timescales.

**Key tension:** The deliberation that makes democratic governance legitimate is the same quality that may make it fatally slow.
