### Reading the Scale

**Outcome Scale:** -5 (civilizational extinction) to +5 (transcendent flourishing)

| Score | Label |
|-------|-------|
| +5 | **Transcendence** -- Humanity fundamentally elevated beyond current limits |
| +4 | **Flourishing** -- Dramatic improvement in welfare, agency, and meaning |
| +3 | **Beneficial** -- Significant net positive; meaningful problems solved |
| +2 | **Constructive** -- Modestly positive; more gains than losses |
| +1 | **Marginal gain** -- Slight improvement, mostly adaptation |
| 0 | **Neutral / Mixed** -- Gains and losses roughly cancel |
| -1 | **Marginal harm** -- Slight degradation, livable but diminished |
| -2 | **Damaging** -- Significant harm to large populations; recoverable |
| -3 | **Severe** -- Structural damage to civilization; difficult to reverse |
| -4 | **Catastrophic** -- Civilizational collapse or permanent tyranny |
| -5 | **Extinction** -- End of humanity or permanent lock-in to misery |

The two outcome columns capture the central argument of the collection: the gap between "Unmanaged" and "Governed" is the **Governance Dividend**, and it is enormous for precisely the scenarios that are most likely.

### What the Matrix Reveals

**Highest Governance Dividends** (where institutional action matters most):

1. **Intelligence Explosion (#21): 10 pts** -- Outcome swings from extinction to transcendence based entirely on whether alignment is solved first.
2. **The Singleton (#22): 9 pts** -- Whether a dominant AI power becomes benevolent governance or permanent tyranny is a pure governance question.
3. **Cognitive Enhancement (#19): 7 pts** -- Universal access transforms this from the deepest inequality ever into the greatest equalizer ever. The difference is policy.
4. **Labor Erosion (#1) / Neo-Feudalism (#17) / Ecological Reckoning (#10): 6 pts each** -- Where economic and environmental governance can flip outcomes from severely negative to positive.

**Lowest Governance Dividends** (limited institutional leverage):

1. **Human Extinction (#28): 0 pts** -- If it happens, governance failed. Only prevention counts.
2. **Transcendence (#30): Unknown** -- Beyond our ability to evaluate or govern from this side.
3. **Stasis (#29): 1 pt** -- If AI plateaus, stakes are lower and conventional governance suffices.

The scenarios where governance matters most are overwhelmingly the *probable* ones (Tiers 1-3), not the speculative ones (Tiers 4-5). The crisis is not waiting for a dramatic singularity event. It is already here, and the governance dividend is already on the table.
