## How to Read This Document

This appendix presents 28 distinct scenarios for how artificial intelligence might reshape civilization. They are organized into five tiers by estimated likelihood, from near-certain to speculative. Each scenario includes a likelihood assessment, outcome scores across four dimensions (economic, social, political, and existential), and a narrative analysis.

These scenarios are not predictions. They are analytical tools - lenses for seeing the range of futures we face. Many will unfold simultaneously, their effects compounding and interacting in ways that no single scenario can capture. The composite picture below attempts to capture this interaction.

## What the Matrix Reveals

The most striking pattern in the matrix is the asymmetry between probable harm and speculative benefit. The scenarios with the highest likelihood - Tiers 1 through 3 - are overwhelmingly negative across all four dimensions. The scenarios with significant positive potential are concentrated in Tier 5, where uncertainty is highest.

This asymmetry has a simple implication: the expected value of inaction is strongly negative. Waiting to see how AI develops before acting is not a neutral choice. It is a bet that the speculative upsides will materialize while the near-certain downsides will not. That is not a rational bet.

## Composite Picture

No single scenario will define the AI future. The reality will be a composite - multiple scenarios unfolding simultaneously, their effects interacting in complex and often unpredictable ways. Mass displacement will compound the meaning crisis. Epistemic collapse will accelerate democratic erosion. Cognitive stratification will deepen digital neo-feudalism.

The composite picture is not a prediction. It is a warning: the individual scenarios are serious enough in isolation, but their interaction creates systemic risks that exceed the sum of their parts. Governing AI is not about preventing any single scenario. It is about building the institutional capacity to manage the composite - the full painting, with all its shades laid one over another.
