description: "Twelve Essays on the Futures We're Building and the Ones We're Drifting Into"

The most consequential technology in human history is being debated with the wrong questions, defended with remedies that solve nothing, and governed by no one.

These twelve essays offer a different way of seeing. Each one opens a window onto one dimension of the AI future - not to predict, but to make visible what the current discourse obscures. Each one dismantles the reassuring answers that dominate the conversation: skill up, regulate, trust the market, become a plumber. And each one names what we actually need - at the scale of nations and the scale of civilization - without pretending to have all the answers.

The future is not a choice among alternatives. It is a painting composed of many shades laid one over another, each altering the color of what lies beneath. The question is not which shade arrives. It is which mixture - and whether anyone is holding the brush.
