This collection starts from a premise: the AI transformation has already begun. Its wide diffusion is coming. The speed and depth of its impact can be debated. Its imminence cannot.

The debate over whether AI will reshape the economy, the information environment, the labor market, governance, warfare, and daily life is over. It is reshaping them now. The open questions are how fast, how deep, and whether anyone is steering. This collection exists because those questions deserve better answers than the ones currently on offer: skill up, regulate later, trust the market, become a plumber.
