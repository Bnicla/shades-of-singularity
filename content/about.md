## About the Author

Boris Schiapparelli is a writer and thinker working at the intersection of technology, governance, and political philosophy. *Shades of Singularity* is his attempt to bring the rigor of institutional analysis to a conversation too often dominated by techno-optimism, techno-panic, and solutionism.

## About This Project

These essays emerged from a simple observation: the conversation about AI is broken. Not because people disagree - disagreement is healthy - but because the dominant frameworks for thinking about AI are inadequate to the scale of the challenge.

The Hamiltonian framing that runs through these essays is deliberate. Alexander Hamilton understood that the design of institutions determines the fate of nations. He built institutions - a central bank, a federal judiciary, a national debt - that shaped American life for centuries. We face a similar moment: the institutions we build (or fail to build) in the next decade will determine whether AI serves humanity or merely those who control it.

These essays do not pretend to have all the answers. They aim to ask better questions.
