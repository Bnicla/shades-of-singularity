## About the Author

I'm not a public intellectual, a policy expert, or a futurist. I'm an MIT graduate, a product manager who has worked in startups and currently in Big Tech deploying generative AI to hundreds of millions of users.

I don't have a particular authority to write these essays. What I have is a vantage point. I see what these systems can do, how fast they're improving, and how unprepared we are. Every working day, in practice. What strikes me most is the gap between what the people building AI know is coming and what the public conversation is willing to address.

These essays are my attempt to close that gap, or at least to make it visible.

## About This Project

This project started with a question I couldn't stop asking: what happens when a technology that moves faster than any governance structure ever built meets a civilization that has no plan for it?

The AI conversation is dominated by two camps: those who see limitless promise and those who see existential risk. Both are right. Neither is sufficient. What's missing is the institutional question. "Will AI be good or bad?" is the wrong frame. The real question is: "What must we build so that it doesn't destroy us by accident?" The levees, not the flood.

I drew inspiration from Alexander Hamilton. I certainly don't imagine myself in his company, but his method fits this moment. Hamilton looked at a new nation with no functioning economic infrastructure and asked: what institutions does this require? He didn't theorize. He designed. He proposed specific mechanisms (a bank, a mint, a debt system, a tariff structure), each one solving a concrete problem while serving a larger architectural vision. We face a similar design challenge. The institutions we build or fail to build in the next decade will determine whether AI serves ordinary people or only those who control it.

These essays try to apply that method: asking what structures the future requires, and why the answers currently on offer (regulate, skill up, trust the market) are structurally inadequate.

I should be honest about the limits. These essays diagnose more than they prescribe. They name what we need more than they specify how to build it. The institutional design work that AI demands is larger than any single author. It requires economists, legislators, engineers, and citizens working together. What I hope these essays do is make the problem visible enough, and the false remedies untenable enough, that the real work can begin on honest foundations.

## On Writing With AI

These essays were written in collaboration with Claude, Anthropic's AI. I want to be transparent about this. It's an argument, not a disclaimer.

A collection about the futures AI is creating cannot be written as if AI doesn't exist. The tool is part of the subject. Using AI to explore what AI might do to civilization is not a shortcut. It is a necessary part of the method. You would not write about the ocean without getting in the water.

Concretely: I brought the questions, the angles, the moral convictions, and the editorial judgment. Claude brought analytical scale: the ability to hold 28 scenarios in working memory simultaneously, to stress-test arguments against counterarguments in real time, to find structural connections across domains that a single human mind would take months to map. The 28-scenario taxonomy, the identification of 22 gaps the mainstream discourse misses, the thematic architecture of the nine clusters that became these eight essays. All of this emerged from a collaboration that neither of us could have produced alone.

This is itself evidence for one of the collection's central arguments: AI is an extraordinary cognitive amplifier. A $20 subscription gave me the analytical capacity of a small research team. That is the democratization these essays describe, and the trap. Because the same tool that helped me write about institutional design is the tool that is making institutional design urgent. The fact that one person with AI can produce work of this scope is precisely why we need to think seriously about what happens when everyone can, and when the institutions that once required hundreds of experts can be interrogated, stress-tested, and perhaps undermined by anyone with a laptop.

Claude is credited here as co-author because that is the honest description of what happened. The ideas are a genuine collaboration. I would not have arrived at the demand-circuit thesis, the composition fallacy framing, or the systematic dismantling of false remedies without a thinking partner capable of holding the full complexity of the problem. Claude would not have arrived at any of it without someone asking the right questions and refusing to accept comfortable answers.

This is what human-AI collaboration looks like when it works. These essays argue that we need to design institutions for a world where it is the norm.

## Why Now

I wrote these essays with a sense of urgency that I want to be honest about.

In my work, I watch AI capabilities improve in discrete jumps that surprise even the people building them. I watch organizations scramble to adopt tools they don't fully understand. I watch the public conversation cycle between hype and panic without ever landing on the structural questions that actually matter. And I watch the window for institutional design narrow as power concentrations entrench and become self-reinforcing.

I don't know how much time we have. No one does. But the gap between what is coming and what we are prepared for is wide and getting wider. These essays are not the solution. They are an attempt to see clearly, so that the people who do build solutions can start from honest ground rather than comfortable illusions.

The shades are being mixed. The question is whether anyone is holding the brush.
