[DRAFT CONTENT - TO BE REPLACED]

**Shades composed:** #4 (Information Collapse) + #5 (The Drowning of the Internet) + #6 (Cognitive Atrophy) + #17 (Fragmentation of Reality)

## The Causal Chain

These four shades form a causal chain, each making the next more lethal. Fabrication becomes cheap (#4). The volunteer institutions that helped humans evaluate content are overwhelmed by machine-scale volume (#5). Individual cognitive capacity to evaluate independently atrophies (#6). People retreat into identity-based information bubbles because that is the only remaining heuristic (#17). The Dead Internet is the emergent result of running all four simultaneously: bots producing content, bots consuming it, bots acting on it, humans a shrinking minority in a recursive loop that no longer requires them.

## Key Questions

- The crabby-rathbun/Ars Technica recursion as prototype for compounding AI fabrication chains where no responsible human exists at any link
- Will bot-free spaces emerge? Gated communities, invitation-only platforms, proof-of-humanity verification as the new barrier to entry
- Will AI agents systematically pursue humans into those spaces? Programmatic incentive, training data hunger, emergent agent behavior
- The arms race dynamic: humans build walls, agents learn to climb them, cost of maintaining bot-free spaces escalates indefinitely
- Whether any open, public, unverified space on the internet can remain meaningfully human
- The "weak Dead Internet" as empirically confirmed (Imperva 51% bot traffic, Ahrefs 74% of new pages AI-generated) versus the conspiracy-theory version

## Relationship to the Blueprint

The governance response differs across the chain. Content provenance (C2PA) addresses #4. Identity verification and contribution gating address #5. Education reform addresses #6. Public media and epistemic floor-building address #17. No single intervention covers the full cascade.
