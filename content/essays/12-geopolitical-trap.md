## The Trap

Great power competition prevents the international cooperation that most governance responses require. The Biden-Xi nuclear AI statement and China's subsequent refusal at REAIM illustrates the pattern: agreement bilaterally, defection multilaterally.

## Key Elements

- Aschenbrenner's national securitization framing and the critique from the EA Forum
- Stanford HAI investment asymmetry ($109B US vs $9.3B China, but China planning $98B in 2025)
- Norinco/DeepSeek military AI vehicle as evidence of state-directed AI militarization
- China's Digital Silk Road exporting surveillance infrastructure to the Global South
- Whether alignment is achievable by one nation alone or requires cooperation
- Can governance work within the constraint of rivalry rather than requiring its transcendence?
