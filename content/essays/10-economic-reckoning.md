[DRAFT CONTENT - TO BE REPLACED]

**Shades composed:** #1 (Labor Erosion) + #2 (Power Concentration) + #15 (Neo-Feudalism) + #23 (Post-Scarcity)

## The Economic Axis

These four shades form the economic axis of the taxonomy. #1 describes the mechanism (labor devaluation), #2 describes the power dynamics (concentration), #15 describes the failure mode (permanent underclass), and #23 describes the success mode (post-scarcity). The same productivity gains that fund the solution also cause the damage, and distribution is entirely a political question.

## Key Elements

- Acemoglu's 0.5% GDP skepticism vs. optimistic projections
- Freeman's "who owns the robots rules the world"
- Alaska Permanent Fund and Norway sovereign wealth fund as precedents for distributing AI-generated wealth
- Post-scarcity as requiring simultaneous success of #2, #15, #19, #10
- Amodei's optimistic vision and the LCFI Cambridge critique of technocratic utopianism
- The chart from mechanism to power dynamics to failure mode to success mode
