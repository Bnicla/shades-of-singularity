[DRAFT CONTENT - TO BE REPLACED]

**Shades composed:** #18 (Cognitive Enhancement) + #19 (Democratic AI) + #23 (Post-Scarcity) + #9 (Meaning Crisis, inverted)

## The Light Composite

The optimistic composite requires active construction. Democratic AI access layered over cognitive enhancement produces a population equipped to govern AI itself, a positive feedback loop as powerful as any negative one. Add post-scarcity and the meaning crisis transforms from existential wound to creative liberation.

## The Mechanisms

Every claim must be grounded in a specific mechanism that can be built. Amodei's "Machines of Loving Grace" is the closest existing text to this thesis, and its limitations (technocratic, Silicon Valley-centric, Global South blind spot) should inform the approach.

- Democratic AI + cognitive enhancement = population governing AI itself
- Post-scarcity transforms the meaning crisis from wound to liberation
- Must avoid utopianism; ground in buildable institutional mechanisms
- Informed by Amodei's vision and the Cambridge critique of it
